## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Choice of Theme - Creating solutions for women health, safety and upliftment of vulnerable section

Access to safe and hygienic sanitation facilities while travelling is a serious challenge faced by women in developing countries. Without knowing how and where to get clean public washrooms, we often have to compromise our health, hygiene and safety. 

To make it worse, during periods we have no idea if the nearest toilet will have running water and a pad disposer/sanitary dustbin available, considering we even get a toilet in the first place. 

## OUR SOLUTION 

**We Divided the Problem into Two Parts -**

1. Women need access to clean hygienic washrooms available nearby.
2. Private establishment owners need to be incentivised to keep their washrooms clean and hygienic.

**And Narrowed it Down to One Solution**

Giving people information about the nearest available toilets and their condition so that travelling customer traffic gets concentrated to establishments with cleaner toilets by default.

**Product  - TOILET FINDER WEBSITE "SAATHI"**

We will build a web application where users can access their nearest available washrooms and see the cleanliness and hygiene rating of them along with previous user recommendations to help users make an informed choice.

Public Establishments like restaurants, hotels and shops can register their washrooms in our database by providing information including location and pictures of the facilities for approval. A washroom will not receive approval unless they meet the bare minimum set of standards.

Washrooms that maintain a very high user rating will be featured in the top of our searches and the corresponding establishments will hence attract more travelling customers, thus incentivisng them for maintaining cleanliness. Establishmenst that fail to maintain a threshhold rating will be dropped off our list.

## Set Standards

1. Gender segregated washrooms, with at least 3 of each working toilets, water faucets and paper towels.
2. Disposal Bins
3. Evidence of rountine maintenance
